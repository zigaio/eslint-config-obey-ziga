# comma-dangle

## Details

```javascript
'comma-dangle': [2, 'always-multiline']
```

## Reason

I treat dangling-comma like semi. It's a preference to add an `end-of-statement`-like indicator when working with multiline.

The added bonus is that you will not forget to add a comma before adding a newline to your array, object, or function call.
