# func-names

## Details

```javascript
'func-names': [2, 'as-needed']
```

## Reason

It is super annoying when an error message tells you something went wrong in an anonymous function.

When you just created the code that fails, you know where it is. However, 6 months from now you might not. Or heaven forbid, a codebase you inherited fails.

I bet you would praise the dev before you to the heavens if they actually named their functions. Be that dev.
