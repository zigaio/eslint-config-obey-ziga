# function-call-argument-newline

## Details

```javascript
'function-call-argument-newline': [2, 'consistent']
```

## Reason

Enforcing one or the other would become annoying because functions with a few arguments are perfectly fine on a single line, while functions with many arguments quickly can become difficult to decipher for the reader.

However, consistency is required per function call. Either keep everything on a single line, or do a newline per argument.
