# no-warning-comments

## Details

```javascript
'no-warning-comments': 1
```

## Reason

Coding is a complex thing and there might be logic in your applications that you want to develop in stages. It is however a common occurrence that `todo` comments are left in your codebase for a long time (read years) and this config aims to remind you they are present.
